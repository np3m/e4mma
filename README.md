Crust-Density Functional Theory (Crust-DFT)
===

This EOS module constructs equation of states for homogeneous 
nuclear matter with an ensemble of nuclei to be used in 
astrophysical simulations of core-collapse supernovae and
neutron star mergers. 

We implement empirical constraints from 
(i) nuclear mass measurements, (ii) proton-proton scattering 
phase shifts, and (iii) neutron star observations. Our model 
is also guided by microscopic many-body theory calculations 
based on realistic nuclear forces, including the zero temperature 
neutron matter equation of state from quantum Monte Carlo 
simulations and thermal contributions to the free energy from 
finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory. 

We ensure
that the parameters of our model can be varied while preserving 
thermodynamic consistency and the connection to experimental or 
observational data, thus providing a probability distribution of the
astrophysical hot and dense matter equation of state.
